## Laboratory Safety Rules

- Students are required to wear safety goggles when
heating and mixing substances.
- Avoid loose garments. (ALWAYS TUCK IN SHIRTS)

- Students must not enter or work in laboratories
unless a teacher is present.
• No unauthorised experiments. Apparatus or
chemicals are not allowed out of the laboratory
without the permission of a teacher.
• Laboratory storerooms and preparation rooms are
out of bound to all students.
• Eating and drinking are prohibited in laboratories.
• Students should always work thoughtfully and
purposefully. Practical jokes and other acts of
carelessness are strictly prohibited.

Testing of Odours
• Do not smell the flask directly.
• If you must smell the odour, carefully waft the odour
from the flask toward your nose with your hand.

Heating of Test Tubes
• Keep the flask a distance from your face.
• Make sure that the test tubes are NOT directed towards yourself or your classmates.

Chemicals (e.g.: Acids and Water)
• The heat generated may cause splattering.
• If it is necessary to prepare certain solutions, add acid
to water instead.
• Always wear eye protection.
• Chemicals or other materials must never be tasted
unless specifically directed by the teacher.

Others
• Unlabelled chemicals should not be used. Unlabelled
containers should be reported to the teacher.
• Students should seek clarification from the teacher if
instructions for an experiment are not thoroughly
understood. Students should not proceed with an
experiment if in doubt.

Others
• Equipment used to handle or transfer hazardous
materials must be inspected for leaks, cracks and
other forms of damage before use.
• Pipetting should always be carried out using a pipette
aid and never by mouth.
• Sharps (such as needles, razors or pins) should not
be discarded in waste-bins or trash bags. Instead, a
sturdy container should be used for sharp waste
objects..

- Damaged equipment, breakages, accidents and
spillage should be immediately reported to your
teacher.
• Sweep away the broken glass using a broom and a
dustpan.
• Place the broken glass in a container designated for
sharp objects.

## Common Safety Equipment in the Laboratory

Fire Extinguisher
There are two main types of fire extinguishers:
• Carbon dioxide

Fire Blanket
• Remove the blanket from the container.
• Wrap it around the victim to put out the fire.

First Aid Kit
• Inform teacher of all injuries
• Items in the kit may be
used temporarily for
small injuries.

Sand Bucket
• They are often kept next to ovens, barbecues, and
other areas where fires can occur. Oil fires are
resistant to water, a fire sand bucket is used.
• Inform teacher when use is required.

- Throw all used solutions into the sink, unless
otherwise stated by your teachers.
• HOWEVER, All solid waste should be thrown in a
dustbin.
• Wash all apparatus and return them to their original
locations.
• Wipe safety goggles after wearing during practical
lesson
• Always wash your hands thoroughly before and after every practical lesson

# The Scientific Method

| Step 1: Engaging with
an event
• Obtaining information
• Pose questions
• Defining problems
• Generate ideas
• Propose hypothesis
and make predictions | Step 2: Collecting and
Presenting Evidence
• Using our five senses
to make observations
• Planning and carrying
out experiments | Step 3: Making Meaning of
Information and Evidence
• Evaluate experimental
results
• Communicate findings |
| --- | --- | --- |

a) Hypothesis 

A hypothesis is a tentative statement that proposes a possible explanation to
some phenomenon. It is based on some previous observation and is a testable
statement which may include a prediction.

b) Variables 

When we test a hypothesis, the things that have an effect on the experiment are
called variables.

# Bunsen Burner

![Untitled](Chapter%201%20The%20Scientific%20Endeavour/Untitled%205.png)

a) How to use a Bunsen burner

1. Close the air hole by turning collar.
2. Start the lighter and place above nozzle.
3. Turn on the gas tap.
4. Bunsen will light with an orange-yellow flame. (If flame goes out, turn off gas
tap and try again).
5. Open the air hole by turning collar to obtain stable flame

b) Type of flame
