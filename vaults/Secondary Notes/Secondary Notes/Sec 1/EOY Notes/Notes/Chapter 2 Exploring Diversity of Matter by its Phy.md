## 1 Physical Quantities

 Physical quantity is a quantity that can be measured by specific scientific
instruments. E.g. length, volume, time and temperature
 Measurements are expressed in two parts: numerical and unit. E.g. 21 metres
or 15 kilograms
 The International System of Units, SI units (Systeme Internationale d’ Unites in
french) was used to overcome the problems of different units of measurement.
o This ensures a standard of units used in scientific measurement
recognised internationally.

## 2 Measuring Length

 SI unit: metres Symbol: m
 Other common units of length:

- Centimetre (cm): 1 cm = 0.01 m
- Millimetre (mm): 1mm = 0.001 m
- Kilometre (km): 1 km = 1000 m

- Common instruments used to measure lengths: ruler, half-metre rule or a metre-rule, measuring tapes, Vernier calipers and micrometer screw gauge.

## (b) Volume of irregular solids

 Measured with “water displacement method”.

1. Lower object carefully into a
measuring cylinder containing
water, water level rises.
2. Water is displaced by the solid
3. Volume of solid = volume of water
displaced

## 4) Measuring Mass

 Mass is the amount of substance
packed in the object.
 SI unit: Kilogram
 Symbol: kg

Other common units of volume:

- Tonnes ( t ) : 1 t = 1 000 kg = 1 000 000 g
- Grams ( g ): 1 000 g = 1 kg
- Milligrams ( mg ): 1 mg = 0.001 g
= 0.000 001kg

Instruments to measure mass: double beam balance and electronic mass balance.

## 5 Accuracy, Precision and Errors

a) Parallex error is an error made in measurements when the eye is positioned
wrongly.

b) Accuracy of measurements refers to the closeness of agreement between the
measured value and the true value of what is being measured.

 If the measured value is very close to the true value the measurement is accurate.
 If the measured value is far away from the true value the measurement is not accurate.

c) Precision of measurement refers to the closeness of agreement between
measured values obtained by repeated measurements.

 If the repeated measured value are very close to each other the measurement is precise.
 If the repeated measured value are far away from each other the measurement is not precise.

## d) Types of Errors

![Untitled](Chapter%202%20Exploring%20Diversity%20of%20Matter%20by%20its%20Phy/Untitled%209.png)

**Random Error vs. Systematic Error**
• Systematic error always affects measurements the same amount or by the
same proportion, provided that a reading is taken the same way each time. It
is predictable.
• Random error causes one measurement to differ slightly from the next. It
comes from unpredictable changes during an experiment.
• Random errors cannot be eliminated from an experiment, but most systematic
errors may be reduced.

## 6) Physical Properties of Materials

 Physical property of a substance is a characteristic that can be observed without
causing any permanent change to an object.

 Materials can also be classified based on their physical properties.

 Common properties:

1. Strength: ability to support a heavy load without breaking or tearing.
2. Hardness: ability to scratch another material.
3. Density: amount of mass present in per unit volume of a substance.
4. Melting point: The temperature at which a substance changes from
a solid to a liquid.
5. Boiling point: The temperature at which a substance changes from
a liquid to a gas.
6. Electrical conductivity: Measures how easily electricity can pass
through a substance.
7. Thermal conductivity: Measures how easily heat can pass through
a substance
8. Flexibility: Ability to bend without breaking, and to return to its
original shape.
9. Malleability: Ability to be beaten into shapes.
10. Ductility: Able to be stretched into wires.

## 7) Density

(a) What is density?

 Density is the amount of mass present in per unit volume of a substance.
 SI unit: kg/m3
 Other units: g/cm3

(more common)

 Formula: 

![Untitled](Chapter%202%20Exploring%20Diversity%20of%20Matter%20by%20its%20Phy/Untitled%2011.png)

**One Example:** 

Calculate the volume of a wooden block (density = 0.6 g/cm3) that has a mass of 600 g.

600 g / 0.6g/cm3 = 1000cm3

The volume of the wooden block is 1000cm3. 

(b) Floating and sinking

 Objects made of the same substances have the same density.

 The ability of an object to float or sink in a liquid depends on the densities of
the object and the liquid.

- Less dense objects float on denser liquids.
- Denser objects sink in less dense liquids.

Densities of some common substances

| Substance | Density / g/cm3  |
| --- | --- |
| Air  | 0.00129 |
| Alcohol | 0.79 |
| Petrol  | 0.80 |
| Pure Water  | 1.00 |
| Aluminium  | 2.7 |
| Gold  | 19.3 |

(e) Criteria for choosing materials

- Different materials have different properties with different strengths and
limitations for specific uses.
- Some materials are more suitable than others to make an object for a particular
purpose or use.
- The criteria for choosing a particular material to make an object refers to the
physical properties that an object must have for it to be useful.

**(f) Experiments used to investigate physical properties**

Investigating electrical properties
 Set-up an open circuit, leaving two ends open.
 Connect open ends to the material of investigation.
 A conductor will light up the bulb but an insulator
will not.
Investigating thermal properties
 Set-up a beaker of water over a Bunsen burner.
 Place the material of investigation into the water
and wax on the tip of the material.
 A conductor will melt the wax, an insulator will
not.

**(g) Conservation of materials**

**** Why do we need to conserve materials?

- The Earth has a limited amount of materials, which can be depleted one day
- Some of the discarded materials are ‘non-biodegradable’ (i.e., cannot be
broken down by bacteria) and cause pollution.
- Rubbish that are incinerated often cause air pollution.
 How do we conserve materials?
- Reduce: use less
e.g. use both sides of paper, use own shopping bag instead of plastic bags
provided by shops
- Reuse: use old things again instead of throwing them away
- Recycle: Use old things to make new things
- Glass, metals, and some plastics can be recycled by melting them down to be
made into new products
