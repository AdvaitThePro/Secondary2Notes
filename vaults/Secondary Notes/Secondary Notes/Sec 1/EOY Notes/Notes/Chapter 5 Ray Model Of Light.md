# What is light?

- Light is a form of energy
- It enables us to see when it enters in our eyes
- Light travels in straight lines
- Light travels at a speed of $3\times10^8\text{ } \text{m/s}^2$  in a vacuum

## What is a shadow?

---

- When light shines on an object, some rays of lights are blocked and other rays continue to travel in a straight line
- The dark area behind the object which does not receive light is called a light ray.

## What is a reflection?

---

The image in a mirror is formed when light rays bounce and bounce off the mirror and travel to your eyes. This bouncing of light off a mirror is called a reflection.

### Features of a Ray Diagram

---

| Terminology  | Definition |
| --- | --- |
| Plane mirror | A flat mirror |
| Normal | The line ON is perpendicular to the mirror at the point of incidence |
| Incident Ray | The ray OA that strikes the mirror |
| Angle of Incidence (∠i) | Angle between the incident ray and the normal |
| Reflected Ray | The ray OB that bounces off the mirror |
| Angle of reflection (∠r) | Angle between the reflected ray and the normal |
