# Model Of Matter: The Particulate Nature Of Matter

---

## The Physical Properties of the 3 Different states of matter

---

|  | Solid | Liquid | Gas |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| Example | Ice cube | Water | Oxygen |
| Shape | Have definite shapes | Take the shapes of the containers. | Take the shape of containers |
| Volume | Have definite volumes. | Have definite volumes | Take on the volume of the container |
| Density | Highest density | Lower density then solids | Take on the volume of the containers  |
| Compressability | Cannot be compressed | Cannot be compressed | Easily Compressed |

## Using the Particulate Nature of Matter as a Model

## Brownian Motion

- Robert Brown, a botanist discovered evidence of Brownian movement

*Experiment: Observing tiny particles of pollen in suspension in water through a microscope.*

![Untitled](Chapter%207%20The%20Particulate%20Nature%20Of%20Matter/Untitled%203.png)

Observation: Smaller particles were moving about continuously in a haphazard way. This is because the tiny particles were bombarded by the liquid molecules around them. The direction of the resultant force is constantly changing. “Brownian motion” is defined as the random or zig zag motion of the suspended molecules. 

Under the microscope: Smoke particles are seen moving haphazardly as a result of being bombarded by unseen fast-moving air molecules. Dotted lines represent the path the smoke particles.

Brownian motion provides evidence for the kinetic molecular model of matter. (Kinetic Theory of Matter)

## Using the Particulate Nature of Matter as a Model

---

Matter is made of tiny discrete particles (atoms, molecules or ions)

Scientists found out that the particles:

- are very small and cannot be seen with a microscope
- all particles of one pure substance are identical
- are in constant random motion

Tiny: cannot be seen with a microscope

Discrete: Single and countable particles. *E.g. Not a shapeless mass*

## Models of States of Matter

---

| Characteristics  of Particles | Explanation |
| --- | --- |
| Forces between particles | When particles are attracted to each other |
| Movement/Motion | How the particles move about |
| Arrangement | When particles are orderly arranged or disorderly and whether they are close or far apart |

### Rules of drawing

---

1. Drawn in *2D Side View* NOT 3D
2. Not necessary to show vibration of particles
3. Size should be approximately the same.
4. Half drawn particles are NOT accepted

---

### Particulate Model of Solids

---

![Untitled](Chapter%207%20The%20Particulate%20Nature%20Of%20Matter/Untitled%208.png)

| Characteristics of particles | Solids |
| --- | --- |
| Forces between particles | Very strong forces of attraction |
| Movement/Motion | Vibrate about its fixed position |
| Arrangement | Very closely and orderly packed |

---

### Particulate Model of Liquids

---

![Untitled](Chapter%207%20The%20Particulate%20Nature%20Of%20Matter/Untitled%209.png)

| Characteristics of Particles | Liquids |
| --- | --- |
| Forces between particle  | Moderate forces of attraction (weaker as compared to solids) |
| Movement/Motion | Able to slide past one another |
| Arrangement | Not as closely packed as solids and disorderly arranged |

---

### Particulate Model of Gas

---

![Untitled](Chapter%207%20The%20Particulate%20Nature%20Of%20Matter/Untitled%2010.png)

| Characteristics of Particles | Gas |
| --- | --- |
| Forces between particles | Very weak or
negligible forces of
attraction |
| Movement / Motion | Move freely in all
directions and at
high speeds |
| Arrangement | Very far apart and disorderly arranged |
