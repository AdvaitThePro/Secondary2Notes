The sea is a hungry dog,
Giant and grey.
He rolls on the beach all day.
With his clashing teeth and shaggy jaws
Hour upon hour he gnaws
The rumbling, tumbling stones,
And 'Bones, bones, bones, bones!'
The giant sea-dog moans,
Licking his greasy paws.

And when the night wind roars
And the moon rocks in the stormy cloud,
He bounds to his feet and snuffs and sniffs,
Shaking his wet sides over the cliffs,
And howls and hollos long and loud.

But on quiet days in May or June,
When even the grasses on the dune
Play no more their reedy tune,
With his head between his paws
He lies on the sandy shores,
So quiet, so quiet, he scarcely snores.

### What are your impressions of the sea?

| Point
Answer the question in your first sentence | My first impression is that the sea is powerful. |
| --- | --- |
| Evidence
Where in the poem tells you that the sea is powerful?
- Copy from the poem
- 6-8 words
- Put what you have copied in quotation marks | This is clear from how it is described as a “hungry dog” that is “giant and grey” |
| Analysis
1. Name the literary technique
2. What do the specific words DENOTE (literal meaning)?
3. What do the specific words CONNOTE (Ideas/Feelings associated with the main word) | The metaphor (literary technique) which compares the sea to a “hungry” dog denotes a dog that is starving and is in need of food to fill its stomach. This connotes a sense of danger and aggression as the hungry dog may devour everything in its path. Furthermore, the sea is said to be a dog that is “giant”. This means that the dog, and therefore the sea, is humungous/massive. Similarly, the sheer size of the dog conveys a feeling of threat and danger, which shows me that the sea can be intimidating. |
| Evidence
Where in the poem tells you that the sea is powerful?
- Copy from the poem
- 6-8 words
- Put what you have copied in quotation marks | In addition. the sea is also described to have “clashing teeth and shaggy jaws”. |
| Analysis
1. Name the literary technique
2. What do the specific words DENOTE (literal meaning)?
3. What do the specific words CONNOTE (Ideas/Feelings associated with the main word) | The imagery of the dog with “clashing teeth” denotes a dog with very sharp teeth, opening and closing its jaws forcefully which creates an image of a ferocious dog.  |
| Link - Connect to the point | This shows me that the sea, like this ferocious dog, can be fierce and aggressive and therefore, intimidating. |
