## What are Tropical rainforests and where are they found?

---

### Description of Tropical Climate

| Characteristics | High annual rainfall (2,000 to 4,500 mm), high annual temperature, therefore, able to support vegetation such as tropical rainforests and mangroves |
| --- | --- |
| Location | Along the equator, between latitudes 20° N and 20° S found in Central and South America, West and Central Africa, as well as South and Southeast Asia |

## What are the characteristics of Tropical Rainforests?

---

| Characteristics | Descriptions/Examples |
| --- | --- |
| Evergreen  | Do not shed all their leaves at particular times of the year. Continuously grow new leaves. |
| Variety of plant species | Tembusu Tree, Tempinis Tree, Kapok Tree, Rain Tree |
| Three main layers of tropical rainforests vertical structure | emergent, canopy, undergrowth |

## Rainforest Layers

---

| layers | description | example |
| --- | --- | --- |
| emergent | tallest trees in the tropical rainforest, grow up to 30 metres | Kapok Tree, up to 60m, mostly found in Mexico and West Africa |
| Canopy | Grow very close to one another, crowns interlock to form a thick mass of branches and leaves, preventing 97% - 98% of sunlight from passing through to reach forest floor, grow up to 20-30 metres | Tembusu Tree, up to 30 metres, mostly found in Singapore |
| Undergrowth | Very little sunlight is able to reach this layer, plants that are able to grow in the shades and the seedlings of taller trees | Dogwood Tree, up to 10m, mostly found in Eastern Texas, USA |

## Adaptations of Tropical Rainforests

Adaptation 1: Broad Leaves

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One adaptation is broad leaves.  | Broad leaves has a large surface area, and can absorb more sunlight at a given time. | Found in the Oak Tree, commonly located in North America.  |

Adaptation 2: Waxy Leaves 

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Another adaptation is waxy leaves.  | Waxy leaves have a glossy appearance, leathery or hairy surface to allow the plant to lose less water and reduce transpiration  | Found in the rubber trees, commonly located in Peru and Brazil  |

Adaptation 3: Drip Tip 

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Another adaptation is Drip Tip.  | Drip Tip leaves have narrow, downward pointing tips to prevent water from staying on the leaves, thus reducing the growth of fungi and algae  | Found in the Fig Tree, commonly located in the Mediterranean and India.  |

Adaptation 4: Buttress Roots 

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| The last adaptation is buttress roots. | Buttress roots grows 1 to 5 metres above the ground and it helps to support and anchor the tree firmly to the ground.  | Buttress roots are found in the Arjun Tree, commonly located in Sri Lanka and Bangladesh.  |

## Environmental Functions of Tropical Rainforests

Environmental Function 1: Generating Oxygen

| State | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One environmental function of tropical rainforest is generating oxygen.  | This refers to tropical rainforests helping the earth to ‘breathe’, where they help in generating oxygen into the atmosphere. | For example, more than 20% of the earths oxygen is generated by the Amazon Rainforest.  |

Environmental Function 2: Carbon Storage 

| State | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Another environmental function of the tropical rainforest is carbon storage | This means that the rainforests will absorb carbon dioxide from the atmosphere during photosynthesis, storing them in the plants  | For example, the tropical rainforests absorb about 2.4 billion tones of carbon dioxide in a year.  |

Environmental Function 3: Reduction in Soil Erosion 

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Another environmental function of the tropical rainforest is reduction is soil erosion.  | Soil erosion is the removal of the top layers of the soil by rainwater, wind and destructive human activities. Tropical rainforests reduce the chances of soil erosion.  | For example, countries such as Ecuador and Indonesia adopt reforestation to avoid soil erosion of mountainous areas  |

## Uses of tropical rainforests by Human

One use of tropical rainforests by Human: A place for Habitation 

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| One of the use of rainforests by Human is a place for habitation  | This means that Indigenous people using the physical environment get to use their basic household needs such as water, food, shelter and clothing  | One example of a place for habitation is The Korowai Tribe in New Guinea, where it stills inhabits the place for habitation in its rainforest. |

Another use of tropical rainforests by Human: A place for Recreation 

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Another use of the rainforest is a place for recreation | This means that people who lives in towns and cities can get closer to nature by using it for leisure activities | For example, Trekking, camping and birdwatching are common activities that people take part in while visiting the forest. |

Another use of tropical rainforests by Human: A source of Raw Materials 

| State  | Define  | Example  |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Another use of rainforests by humans is a source of raw materials. | They are best known for being valuable sources of wood for building and carpentry. | For example, the Teak, mahogany, rosewood are found in forests, which are valued for their strengths and durability. |
