# 1. The Basic Units of Life

---

- Organisms are composed of one (unicellular) or more cells (multicellular).
- Bacteria and Amoeba are examples of unicellular organisms.
- Plants and animals are examples of multicellular organisms.
- Most cells are too small to be seen by the naked eye; one way to study cells is to use a microscope

# 2. Parts of a cell

---

- Cells can be broadly categorised into animal and plant cells.
- The following are common structures present in both plant and animal cells
    
    ![[animal_and_plant_cell.jpg]]
    

| Parts | Function |
| --- | --- |
| 1. Cell Membrane

A thin and partially permeable membrane surrounding the cell. | Controls the substance entering and leaving the cell
- Generally allows glucose, water and oxygen to enter.
- Generally allows waste products to leave
Serves as a barrier between the cell and the external environment. |
| 2. Cytoplasm

A jelly-like substance within the cell | Controls many organelles (e.g. mitochondria)
- Mitochondria is the site where energy is obtained from food substances during cellular respiration
- Contains jelly-like substance
- Site where many chemical reactions take place. |
| 3. Nucleus

Largest structure in the cell and spherical shape | - Contains chromosomes which carry genetic information
- Controls all cell activities (e.g. repair of worn-out parts)
- Responsible for cell reproduction and cell division

Chromosomes
- Long thread- like structures found in nucleus
- Contains genes that carry genetic material (DNA: deoxyribonucleic acid) to be passed on to offspring |
| 4. Vacuole

- Fluid-filled spaces surrounded by membranes.
- Found in the cytoplasm | Stores water and other nutrients

Small and numerous in animal cells.
One large and central vacuole in plant cells |

## Summary Table - Structural Differences between Animal and Plant cells

---

| Feature | Plant cell | Animal cell |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Cell wall | Presemt | Absent |
| Number and size of vacuoles | One large central Vacuole | Numerous and Small Vacuoles |
| Chloroplast | Present | Absent |

## Functions of a cell wall, chloroplast and vacuole in plant cells

---

| Structure | Function |
| --- | --- |
| Cell Wall
- Thick layer surrounding cell membrane
- Made up of cellulose | - Supports, protects and gives shape to the cell. 
- Fully permeable to substances |
| Chloroplasts
- Contains the green pigment chlorophyll  | - Chlorophyll is needed for absorption of sunlight required for photosynthesis |
| Vacuole
- Usually a single large fluid-filled space surrounded by a membrane | - Filled with cell sap, which contains the water and dissolved minerals |

# 3. Forming a multicellular organism

---

- Cells with specific functions are organised into tissues
- Different tissues are in turn grouped into organs
- Many organs are then grouped into organ systems
