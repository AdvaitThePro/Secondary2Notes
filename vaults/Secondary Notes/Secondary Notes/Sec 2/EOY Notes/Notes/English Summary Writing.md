## How to paraphrase?

Paraphrasing is re-writing a phrase or sentence so that it has the same meaning but different words, phrases and sentence structures. 

Here are some tips that can help you to paraphrase. 

### 1. Use synonyms

Synonyms are words that have the same meaning. Using synonyms is an easy way to create a new sentence that has the same meaning. 

For example: 

i) 

Before Paraphrasing: My car needs petrol 

After Paraphrasing: My car requires fuel. 

ii) 

Before: Some people think that parents should teach their children how to be good members of society. 

After: Some individuals believe that parents should teach their children how to be a positive part of their community. 

iii) 

Before: Violent crime is on the rise among teenagers. 

After: Violent offences are rising among young people. 

*Note: Make sure that your synonym has the* same *meaning and not similar as this could change the meaning of the sentence.* 

## 2. Changing of Word Order

Putting words and phrases in different places within the same sentence is another simple way to paraphrase. But donâ€™t change the word order without thinking about how this affects the grammar of the sentence. You can add a word, subtract a word or change the form of the word. 

For example: 

i)

Before: The percentage of stressed children in western society has increased by 15% in the last ten years. 

After: In the last ten years, the percentage of stressed children in western society has increased by 15%. 

## 3. Changing the Word Form

Changing the form of the word involves changing vocabulary from nouns to verbs, adjectives to adverbs and more. 

For example: 

i) 

Before: Nowadays, crimes are becoming more violent. 
After: Nowadays, crimes are being committed more violently. 

## 4. Reordering Sentences

This means that the sentenced are reordered but still has the same meaning. 

For example: 

Before reordering: Thai boxing is a popular sport and is spectated by many people 

After reordering: Spectated by many fans, Thai boxing is extremely popular. 

## 5. Combining Sentences

Combining sentences gives you more opportunity to change word order as well as shows off more variety in your writing. Use connectors such as while, moreover, but etc. 

For example: 

Before combining: Some people believe that animals should have the same rights as humans. Other people believe that animals should be used for various needs such as food and research. 

After combining: Some people believe that animals should have the same rights as humans, while others believe they should be used for various needs such as food and research. 

^^ All those examples are just examples from different sentences and stories. You need not memorise any of the examples.
