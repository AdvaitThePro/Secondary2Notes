# Topics Tested for EOY / What you need to Know

**Chapter 1: Primes, Highest Common Factor and Lowest Common Multiple** 

1.1             Prime Numbers 

1.2             Square Roots and Cube Roots 

1.3             Highest Common Factor and Lowest Common Multiple 

SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 1 

1. A **prime number** is a whole number that has *exactly 2 different factors*, 1 and itself. For example: 2 and 7. 
2. (a) A **composite number** is a whole number that has *more than 2 different factors*. Examples of composite numbers are 6 and 15. 
    
    (b) The process of expressing a composite number as a product of its prime factors is known as **prime factorisation.** For example, 18 = 2 x 3 x 3 (2 x 3 squared) 
    
3. Whole numbers can be classified into three groups: Neither prime nor composite; Prime Numbers; Composite Numbers 
4. A **perfect square** (or square number) is a whole number whose **square root** is also a whole number. An example of a perfect square is 25, because 25 = 5 squared.

SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 2

1. **Real Numbers** are numbers that can be represented by values on a number line. They can be classified as rational numbers and irrational numbers as shown below. 

| Rational Numbers | Terminating Decimals or Recurring Decimals |
| --- | --- |
| Irrational Numbers | Non-Terminating Decimals and non-recurring Decimals  |
| Integers (Whole Numbers) | Positive Integers / Zero  |
| Integers (Negative Integers) | Numbers below the 0 at the number line (e.g -4, -7) |
1. **Addition and Subtraction involving negative numbers** 

Addition of two negative numbers: (-2) + (-3) = (-5) 

Addition of a positive and a negative number: 5 + (-2) = 3 

Subtraction between two positive numbers: 2 - 5 = -3 

Subtraction of a positive number from a negative number: -5 - 2 = -7 

Subtraction of a negative number: 5 - (-2) = 7

**Chapter 3: Approximation and Estimation** 

3.1 Rounding and significant figures 

3.2 Approximation and approximation errors in real-world contexts 

3.3 Estimation and Estimation in real-world contexts

SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 3: 

1. **Five rules to identify which are significant** 
    
    Rule 1: All non-zero digits are significant 
    
    Rule 2: All zeros between non-zero digits are significant 
    
    Rule 3: In a decimal, all zeros before a non-zero digit are not significant 
    
    Rule 4: In a decimal, all zeros after a non-zero digit are significant 
    
    Rule 5: The zeros at the end of a whole number may or may not be significant, depending on how the number is rounded off. 
    
2. **Approximation** is the process of rounding off a given number to give an approximate value. 
3. **Follow-through errors** can occur if *non-exact values* in intermediate working are not rounded off to a sufficient degree of accuracy. 

(a) For **presentation purpose**, we usually write 4 or 5 s.f. for intermediate non-exact values if we want the final answer to be accurate to 3 significant figures.

(b) For **accuracy purpose**, we always use the values stored in the calculator to compute the next step of the working 

1. **Estimation** is the process of guessing the value of an *unknown* quantity in real life.

**Chapter 4: Basic Algebra and Algebraic Manipulation** 
      4.1 Basic algebraic concepts and notation 

4.2 Addition and subtraction of linear terms 

4.3 Expansion and factorisation of linear expressions 

4.4 Linear expressions with fractional coefficients 

SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 4 

1. In algebra, **letters** are used to represent *different kinds of numbers,*  such as specific unknown numbers, generalised numbers and variables. 
2. A **linear expression** in one *variable* x is an algebraic expression that contains only one term in x, with or without a constant term. 
    
    An example of a linear expression in x is 2x + 7: it consists of two *terms*, 2x and 7, where the *coefficient* of x is 2 and the *constant term* is 7.
    
    1. **Evaluating** an algebraic expression is the process of finding the value of the expression when its variables are given certain values. 
    2. **Factorising** is the process of expressing an algebraic expression as the *product* of two or more factors. It is the reverse of expansion 
    
    $2(x+y)$  expand into $2x+2y$

    **Chapter 5: Linear Equations** 
    
    5.1 Linear Equations
    
    5.2 Linear Equations with fractional coefficients and fractional equations 
    
    5.3 Applications of linear equations in real-world contexts 
    
    5.4 Mathematical formulae 
    
    SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 5
    
    1. **Solving of equations** 
    
    To solve an equation in $x$ means to find out the value for $x$ for which the equation is true. 
    
    This usually involves *isolating* $x$ on one side of the equation. 
    
    For linear equations, we can isolate $x$  by adding, subtracting, multiplying or dividing by the same number on both sides of the equation. 
    
    For example: to solve $x-2=7$, we add to both sides of the equation:
    
     $x-2=7$
    
    $x-2+2=7+2$
    
    $x=9$
    
    1. **Solving of linear equations with fractional coefficients and fractional equations**
    
    One method to solve a linear equation with fractional coefficients, or a fractional equation, is to convert it into a linear equation with integer coefficients by multiplying both sides of the equation by the Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of the denominators of the fractions. 
    
    1. **Mathematical Formulae** 
    
    A formula is an equation that expresses the relationship between certain quantities or variables in algebraic terms, eg $A=l$  x $b$. We can calculate an unknown value when given the values of other variables.

    **Chapter 6: Linear Functions and Graphs** 
    
    6.1 Cartesian coordinates 
    
    6.2 Functions 
    
    6.3 Linear Functions 
    
    6.4 Applications of linear graphs in real-world contexts
    
    SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 6 
    
    1. **Cartesian coordinate system** 
    
    A Cartesian plane consists of two axes, the $x-axis$ and the $y-axis$, intersecting at right angles at the origin O(0,0). The position of a point P on a Cartesian plane can be described by an ordered pair ($x,y$). We call $x$ the $x-$coordinate of P and $y$ the $y-coordinate$ of P. 
    
    1. **Function** 
    
    A function is a relationship between the two variables $x$  and $y$ such that every input $x$  produces *exactly one input* $y$. 
    
    The input $x$ and the output $y$ of a function can be written as an ordered pair ($x,y)$. 
    
    A function can be represented using words, an equation, a table of values and a graph. 
    
    An example of a linear function is $y=2x+3$
    
    1. **Equation of straight line** 
    
    The equation of a straight line is $y=mx+c$, where the constant $m$  is the *gradient* of the line and the constant $c$ is the $y$-intercept. 
    
    1. **Gradient of straight line** 
    
    The gradient of a straight line is a measure of its steepness:

    If a line slopes upwards from left to right, its gradient is positive. 
    
    If a line slopes downwards from left to right, its gradient is negative. 
    
    1. **Distance-time graph** 
    
    The gradient of a line in a distance-time graph is a measure of the speed of the object.

    **Chapter 7: Number Patterns** 
    
    7.1 Number sequences 
    
    7.2 Number sequences and patterns 
    
    SUMMARY FOR CHAPTER 7 
    
    1. **Number sequence** 
    
    A number sequence is formed by a set of **terms**, which are governed by a specific rule. 
    
    An example of a number sequence is -3, 1, 5, 9, 13, 17â€¦ The rule that generates the sequence is: starts with -3, then add 4 to each term to get the next term. 
    
    1. **General term** 
    
    The general term Tn, of a number sequence can be represented by an algebraic expression in terms of its term position, $n$. We say that Tn is a function of $n$. 
    
    1. **Methods of finding the general formula of a sequence.** 
    
    (a) Looking for a pattern by examining the common difference between consecutive terms in the sequence. 
    
    (b) Transforming the original sequence to another more familiar sequence. 
    
    (c) By observation (based on the relationship between a sequence and its graph) 
    
    1. Number patterns have useful applications in real life. For example, the Fibonacci sequence appears in patterns of growth in nature.
