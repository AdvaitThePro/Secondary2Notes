## Percentage Change

---

The total births in Singapore fell to 41251 in 2016 after a year of record high birth rates of 42185 in 2015, which experts attributed to the SG50 effect. It continued to fall by 4% in 2017. 
 i) Calculate the total births in 2017
ii) Calculate the percentage decrease in the total births in Singapore from 2015 to 2016

 i) 100% → 41251 (year 2016)
        1% → $41251 \div 100 = 412.51$
      96% → $412.51 \times 96 = 39601$

ii) $\text{Percentage decrease }$  $= \frac{42185 - 41251}{42185} \times 100 = 2.21\%$$\text{ (3 s.f.)}$
