## Common Food Contains
---
- Carbohydrates (Rice, corn, bread, etc.)
- Protiens (Chickens, Green veggies, salmon, cheese, milk, etc.)
- Fats (Oil, salt, butter, coconut, red meat, etc.)
---
## Essential Nutrients For Our Body
---
- Vitamins
- Water 
- Fibre
		- Mineral Salts
---
## Why is the digestive system required?
---
- The digestive system helps breakdown food that we eat so it can be absorbed by the body and used by our body cells. 
- Large food molecules cannot pass through the partially permeable cell membrane but digested food molecules can easily pass through the cell membrane.
---
## The 2 Types of Digestion
---
### Physical
---
- When the ==size== of the food has been changed
- Bigger food becomes smaller
---
### Chemical
---
- When the ==chemical composition== of food is changed. 
- E.g.: Starch becomes sugar
- Required ==enzymes== inside the body
---
## Types Of Enzymes

| Types of Enzymes       | Acts on | Digested End Product |
| ---------------------- | ------- | -------------------- |
| Carbohydrase (Amylase) | Starch  | Maltose              |
| Carbohydrase (Maltase) | Maltose | Glucose              |
| Protease               | Protein | Amino Acids          |
| Lipase                 | Fats    | Fatty & Glyerol      |

# Way to remember

### Amyl==ase==
Starch -> Maltose

### Malt==ase==
Maltose -> Glucose

### Prote==ase==
Proteins -> Amino Acids

### Lip==ase==
Fats -> Fatty Acids and Glycerol

---
## Characteristics of Enzymes
---
Enzymes
1. Are ==specific in their actions==
2. remin ==unchanged== at the end of their reaction
3. are ==required== in ==small amounts==

---
# What happens at the different parts of the digestive system?
---
### Mouth 
---
- Teeth cuts food to which increase the surface area 
- Saliva help break down food with the enzyeme amylase 
- Physical Digestion does occur
- Chemical Digestion also occurs
	- amylase (Starch -> maltose)
---
### Gullet
---
- Presence of muscles that help push the food down to the stomach
- No physical of chemical reaction occurs
---
### Stomach
---
- Has gastric juices which contain hydrochloric acid which kills bacteria and provides the right pH environment for the enzyme protease to work well in
- Physical digestion does occur
- Chemical digestion also occurs
	- Protein -> Amino Acids
---
### Small Intestine
---
- Contains many types of enzymes to ensure complete digestion of food
- Absorption of digested food and water into the bloodstream takes place
- No physical digestion occurs
- Chemical digestion does occur
	- Amylase 
		- Starch -> Maltose
	- Maltase
		- Maltose -> Glucose
	- Protease
		- Protein -> Amino Acids
	- Lipase
		- Fats -> Fatty acids + Glycerol
---
### Large Intestine
----
- Remaining water is absorbed here
- Physical digestion does not occur
- Chemical digestion does not occur
---
### Rectum
---
- Temporarily stores undigested food and faeces
- Physical digestion does not occur
- Chemical digestion does not occur
---
### Anus
---
- Faeces is released through this opening
- Physical digestion does not occur
- Chemical digestion does not occur
---
### Liver
---
- Produces bile which emulsifies fat
- Physical digestion does occur
	- 1 Big fat molecule -(bile)-> many small fat molecules
- No chemical digestion occurs
