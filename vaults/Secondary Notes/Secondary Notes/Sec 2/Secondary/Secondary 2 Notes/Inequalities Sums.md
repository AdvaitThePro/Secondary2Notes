## Question 2

The minimum mark to obtain a Grade A is 75. Joyce managed to achieve an average of Grade A for three of her Science quizzes. What is the minimum mark she scored in her first quiz if she scored 76 and 89 mark in her second and third quizzes respectively?

Let $x$  be the score for the 1st quiz

$$
(\frac{x+76+89}{3} \geq 75)*3

$$

$$
x+165 \geq 225
$$

$$
x \geq 225 -165
$$

$$
x \geq 60
$$

So minimum score is 60
