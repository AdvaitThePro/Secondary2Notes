## Substitution

$2x + y =18$

$x+2y=10$

equation 1 - $4x+2y=36$

equation 2 - $x + 2y = 10$

equation 1 - equation 2 = $(4x+2y)-(x+2y) = 36 - 10$

This is because if negative, you can easily cancel off $2y$ as it $4x + 2y - x - 2y = 26$

From there, you can easily finish the equation

## Elimination

equation 1 - $x - 4y = 5$

equation 2 - $3x+2y=29$

Step 1: Find Lowest Common Multiple (LCM) of 4 and 2 → 2

Step 2: Multiply Equation 2 by 2 to make $2y$ to $4y$ and we call this new equation Equation 3

equation 1 - $x-4y=5$

equation 3 - $6x+4y=58$

Now add equation 1 and equation 3 together. 

equation 1 + equation 3 = $(x-4y) + (6x+4y) = 58 +5$

As we can see above $4y$  can be cancelled as their is a negative and a positive.

From there, the result can be continued on paper.

## For Inequalities

- If on number line, if the inequality is < or >, write a **circle with nothing inside**
- If on the number line, the inequality is **≤ or ≥,** you should write a **filled circle.**

### Best way to Remember inequalities:

The inequality always points to the smaller number.

## Exam Tricks

### How to check for correct answers in simultaneous equations.

- Add Minus sign if $x$ or $y$  is negative.
